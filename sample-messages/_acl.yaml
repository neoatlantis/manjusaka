#
# List all categories for your messages. Your message MUST fall into one of
# such categories. 
#
# CAUTION: Messages sharing same category can be decrypted using the same
# decryption key. If you want to send individual messages to individuals only,
# create individual categories for each of the message!
categories:
    - test
    - parent
    - friend

#
# Normally, passwords for a given category is generated during building process
# randomly. You may also specify some predefined passwords. Between different
# builds, these passwords will not change. It is useful if you don't really
# want to restrict the entrance for a specified category, or in cases that you
# want to leave a password for another category within a decrypted message.
category-passwords:
    test: test  # so the password for category `test` is always `test`

#
# Define all possible questions and their answers.
# 
# Besides categories, you may also define questions requiring the reader to
# answer, before they can actually read the messages. All possible questions
# has to be firstly defined here and then used in your message sources.
#
# When possible, always use questions not so easily guessed. Asking on which
# day in a year you were born requires 365 guesses, but on which weekday only
# 7.
